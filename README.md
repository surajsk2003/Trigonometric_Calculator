# Trigonometric Calculator
This is a simple trigonometric calculator implemented in C++. It allows users to input an angle in degrees and choose to calculate the sine, cosine, or tangent of that angle.

# Features:
- Calculates sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle provided by the user.
<br>
- Angle input is in degrees, and calculations are performed in radians.
<br>
- Users can perform multiple calculations in a single session.
<br>

# How to Use:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
<br>
- Compile the trigonometric_calculator.cpp file using a C++ compiler.
<br>
- Run the executable file generated after compilation.
<br>
- Follow the on-screen instructions to input an angle and choose the trigonometric operation.
<br>
# Dependencies:
- This project requires a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
<br>
- No external libraries are used.

# Example Usage:
Enter the angle in degrees: 45
Choose operation:
1. Sine
2. Cosine
3. Tangent
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1
Sine(45) = 0.707107

Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): y
Enter the angle in degrees: 30
Choose operation:
1. Sine
2. Cosine
3. Tangent
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 2
Cosine(30) = 0.866025

Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): n
